&lt;p&gt;It ran 7 minutes 23 seconds this time ... still enough to steal a break at work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is what is covered:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you often feel like the oddball in your family, your job or your profession?

Drawing on inspiration from the &amp;quot;Island of the Misfit Toys&amp;quot; from the 1964 classic movie Rudolph the Rednosed Reindeer, I outline ways to:

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Celebrate your unique quirks, differences and personal history&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Tie them in with needs in your market &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Be proud of the misfit you are and reflect it in an authentic and kickass brand! &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pictured here is Hermey, the elf who wants to be a dentist, the original disgruntled employee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those that are fans of the movie, I found a really fun link with some of the back story of the characters and how it was made:&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tvparty.com/xmasrudolph.html&quot;&gt;Rudolf:&amp;nbsp; Behind the Scenes&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To check out past episodes or subscribe via RSS, &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/EscapeFromCubicleNationPodcast&quot;&gt;go here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And let me know how you have, or plan to, bring your own brand of &amp;quot;misfit&amp;quot; into your business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This may be uncool to say, but it still gives me goosebumps and a big smile to get an &amp;quot;A-list&amp;quot; link.&amp;nbsp; Mostly, I welcome new readers, and hope I can incite some more broad revolutionary behavior in the workplace.&amp;nbsp; :)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.escapefromcubiclenation.com/photos/uncategorized/red_bow_1.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;200&quot; height=&quot;258&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://www.escapefromcubiclenation.com/get_a_life_blog/images/red_bow_1.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Red_bow_1&quot; alt=&quot;Red_bow_1&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
Wow, has this been an exciting two weeks.&amp;nbsp; Since announcing the Pam&#39;s Favorite Things contest, I have gotten lots of great submissions.&amp;nbsp; I have a strangely maternal feeling about all of them ... I want everyone to succeed and grow their business!&amp;nbsp; But because I know that a big part of business involves positioning and competition, I am choosing my favorite 10 products with the following criteria:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Originality of idea&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;nbsp; I measure this with the non-scientific means of the size smile on my face as I read the description of the product.&amp;nbsp; Some just tickled my funny bone and were unique enough that I thought they would make great non-traditional gifts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Variety in overall selection&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;nbsp; I wanted to make sure that I chose a mixture of gifts, not just&amp;nbsp; 4 kinds of food products or 5 crafty ideas.&amp;nbsp; And a mixture of products for kids and for adults.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Purchase-ready infrastructure&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;nbsp; There were a few products that were great but didn&#39;t have any website or online ordering system, and might be hard to order from.&amp;nbsp; I probably should have included this in the criteria for submission ... I just didn&#39;t see it as a huge problem until after I saw the submissions coming in.&amp;nbsp; So next year, if we choose to do this again, I fully expect that all these early stage businesses will be up and ready to rock and roll.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Originally created product&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Several people submitted services or products that they resell as an independent distributor.&amp;nbsp; While I completely support many ways to make a living as an entrepreneur, in this feature, I want to promote products that have been created from the minds of individual entrepreneurs, not larger companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am actually hyperventilating I am so nervous about having to select winners among so many great entries.&amp;nbsp; So here goes ... described in no particular order:

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pam&#39;s Favorite Things 2006&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1.&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Secrets-Amusement-Games-Revealed-Third/dp/0966965922/sr=8-1/qid=1163729254/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/104-7192233-3343946?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&quot;&gt;The Secrets of Amusement Park Games:&amp;nbsp; Revealed!&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; This one just got me, especially after hearing Brian Richardson&#39;s story:


&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Me being a guy, I wanted to win a big stuffed Tweety for my wife. After trying to toss a softball into the top of a big milk jug and failing miserably, I decided to think about what I was doing. Lo and behold, it went in! &amp;quot;I wonder if there is any information written on the subject of how to win at amusement park games?&amp;quot; I thought.&amp;nbsp; After Yahooing, Altavista-ing, and Hotbotting around the internet (no Google in 1997) I found that there was one out of print book called &amp;quot;Carnival Secrets&amp;quot;. After making a crude ebook (remember its 1997) I charged 10 bucks for somebody to go on my website.&amp;nbsp; In 1999, I put all of my information into book form and sold via the Amazon.com Advantage program, which I am a member of this day.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brian&#39;s quirky book had quite a journey, even being featured in Newsweek.&amp;nbsp; So although this is not a new product, it could be the perfect gift for that carnival-loving son or uncle on your list.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a onclick=&quot;window.open(this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=448,height=298,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39;); return false&quot; href=&quot;http://www.escapefromcubiclenation.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/socks_1.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;100&quot; height=&quot;66&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://www.escapefromcubiclenation.com/get_a_life_blog/images/socks_1.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Socks_1&quot; alt=&quot;Socks_1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.&amp;nbsp; 
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.monthlysocks.com&quot;&gt;Monthly socks&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; I have given a-gift-a-month presents before, the most recent being different blends of Peet&#39;s Coffee for my brother and sister.&amp;nbsp; I loved the twist on this concept in the form of monthly socks ... especially for someone who has a raggedy collection of holey socks like me and my husband.&amp;nbsp; This idea was created in a moment of inspiration between a man (David) who was frustrated by his motley collection of socks and his wife&amp;nbsp; (Elena) who had a brainstorm for a subscription service while receiving her O Magazine.&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.monthlysocks.com/aboutus.html&quot;&gt;The full story here!&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; And you don&#39;t have to get a pair a month if that is too much ... there are smaller quantity options.&amp;nbsp; (I found the sock calculator didn&#39;t work on the site, but it may be fixed by the time this goes to press)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a onclick=&quot;window.open(this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=448,height=260,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39;); return false&quot; href=&quot;http://www.escapefromcubiclenation.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/codebreaker_1.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;100&quot; height=&quot;58&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://www.escapefromcubiclenation.com/get_a_life_blog/images/codebreaker_1.gif&quot; title=&quot;Codebreaker_1&quot; alt=&quot;Codebreaker_1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4.&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.booksbyglenda.com&quot;&gt;I&#39;ll Do it Myself&lt;/a&gt;, a book by Glenda Watson Hyatt.&amp;nbsp; This is not the first time that you will have heard about this book, as I have been blogging about Glenda&#39;s writing project during the last year.&amp;nbsp; I had a moment of hesitation of selecting it since Glenda and I have become good friends and I didn&#39;t want to appear nepotistic, but then I realized that everything that has drawn us together has been around the core purpose of this blog.&amp;nbsp; She submitted it herself as did every other contestant, so I thought it was fair game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This book, 20 years in the making, is Glenda&#39;s life story of&amp;nbsp; living a strong, sassy and courageous life with Cerebral Palsy.&amp;nbsp; She has written it all using only her left thumb.&amp;nbsp; A great gift for parents of children with disabilities, it is also a great, uplifting story for anyone about what you can do to overcome obstacles in your life with some grit, humor, fierce will and determination.&amp;nbsp; I personally want this to become a bestseller and I want to see Glenda on Oprah, perhaps in the episode after &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.escapefromcubiclenation.com/get_a_life_blog/2006/11/dang_am_i_excit.html&quot;&gt;Ramit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a onclick=&quot;window.open(this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=320,height=219,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39;); return false&quot; href=&quot;http://www.escapefromcubiclenation.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/tableplan.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;100&quot; height=&quot;68&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://www.escapefromcubiclenation.com/get_a_life_blog/images/tableplan.gif&quot; title=&quot;Tableplan&quot; alt=&quot;Tableplan&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.perfecttableplan.com/&quot;&gt; Perfect Table Plan&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; This is a software program created by former corporate employee Andy Brice, who created it after &amp;quot;being made redundant in my job as a developer at a .com company&amp;quot; and inspired when he &amp;quot;had to organize the seating plan for his own wedding (what a nightmare!).&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp; As he explains its use for the unfortunate person who has to organize the company holiday party:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Can&#39;t seat Bob near Chuck (after Chuck stole his stapler in 1997) or Gladys near Bill (after that unfortunate incident with the mistletoe at last years Christmas dinner)? PerfectTablePlan can take care of it. Just tell it who to sit together or apart and it will work out your seating plan for you. No more messing around with post-it notes.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is a perfect gift for someone who is getting married or putting on a conference, since you can assign guests to seats by dragging and dropping, manage guest details, RSVPs, meal choices and budgets.&amp;nbsp; And you can print out elegant seating charts and floor plans.&amp;nbsp; It has been used for thousands of events, and even, as Andy says, for royalty, heads of state and film stars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6.&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.galleriapangea.com/&quot;&gt;Galleria Pangea&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; This interesting online store was started by Jason Yuan as a:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;collaborative partnership between Asian and Western friends interested in the relationship of culture and craft. Each of our products has a unique cultural significance and story that we are happy to share with you as you explore with us the rich legacy of artisan craftsmanship bestowed upon us by our collective heritage.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I particularly like the fact that Jason and staff make personal trips to Asia to purchase handcrafts made by local artisans, and ensure that there is not a middleman and that a fair wage is exchanged (there are lots of horror stories of local artists being ripped off by people in the U.S. and Europe who buy wares dirt cheap and sell them for exorbitant profit -- bad karma, in my estimation).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many products to choose from, but the mission really got me:&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;

&amp;quot;Much like our namesake, the archetypical Pangaea continent preceding the separation of the world&#39;s continents, we ultimately hope to make the Earth a little more unified. Please join us in our mission!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.escapefromcubiclenation.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/moviestudy.jpg&quot; onclick=&quot;window.open(this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=220,height=192,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39;); return false&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;100&quot; height=&quot;87&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;Moviestudy&quot; title=&quot;Moviestudy&quot; src=&quot;http://www.escapefromcubiclenation.com/get_a_life_blog/images/moviestudy.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7.&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.makehomemovie.com/&quot;&gt;Home Study for Home Movies&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; This is downright cool .. a home study course developed by Myrtha Chang, a former corporate trainer and instructional designer who took her interest in creating home movies and made a very thorough step-by-step learning program for do-it-yourself videomakers.&amp;nbsp; She talks about restoring and preserving old footage in digital formats, as well as editing the endless hours of rambling footage into a nice package that is fun to watch.&amp;nbsp; There are some entertaining examples on her very detailed sales page (OK, it is really long, but you can&#39;t say she doesn&#39;t answer every question you might have!).&amp;nbsp; Check out the one with the &amp;quot;How to Hug a Baby, A Guide for Ambitious Dogs.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This would make a great companion to the camcorder you were planning to give to a loved one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a onclick=&quot;window.open(this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=336,height=336,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39;); return false&quot; href=&quot;http://www.escapefromcubiclenation.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/knit.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;100&quot; height=&quot;100&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://www.escapefromcubiclenation.com/get_a_life_blog/images/knit.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Knit&quot; alt=&quot;Knit&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;8.&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.purlescence.co.uk/&quot;&gt;Pearlescence&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; I have been told that the market for knitting is huge worldwide ... who would have thunk it!&amp;nbsp; This small company sells beautiful, elegant bags for the classy knitter who wouldn&#39;t be caught dead with a ratty burlap or plastic knitting bag.&amp;nbsp; Founder Robynn Weldon explains:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I am a passionate knitter and want to use beautiful things to practise my hobby. But in the UK, there is very little available beyond ugly grey plastic needles. I got so frustrated with spending hours surfing badly designed US websites to find the products I wanted (and to find out how much they would charge for international shipping) - eventually I stopped asking, &amp;quot;why isn&#39;t anyone importing this stuff?&amp;quot; and started asking &amp;quot;why aren&#39;t I importing this stuff?&amp;quot; I exploited my credit cards and my husband&#39;s fabulous web design skills, and off we went. Purlescence was launched in January 2006 and has been growing steadily; we have very loyal and enthusiastic customers, and a slowly expanding line of products. It&#39;s been a blast.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a onclick=&quot;window.open(this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=448,height=164,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39;); return false&quot; href=&quot;http://www.escapefromcubiclenation.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/coach_bat.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;100&quot; height=&quot;36&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://www.escapefromcubiclenation.com/get_a_life_blog/images/coach_bat.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Coach_bat&quot; alt=&quot;Coach_bat&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;


&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;9. &lt;a href=&quot;http://stores.ebay.com/the-mini-bat-store&quot;&gt;Duluth Bat Company LLC&lt;/a&gt;, founded by Scott Sarisky, makes hand-engraved mini-bats for sports fans.&amp;nbsp; This is a nice example of a simple hand-crafted product sold through an eBay store without a lot of fancy infrastructure.&amp;nbsp; But the story of how it started is a big part of what I liked:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I worked in the corporate world for 23 years.&amp;nbsp; In general I did not enjoy my time there, most of the time I hated my job.&amp;nbsp; I did like the money though.&amp;nbsp; I use to think about businesses I could do but never had the chutzpah to do it.&amp;nbsp; 

My opportunity came in 2003 when I was laid-off from my job at HP.&amp;nbsp; 

One day, while looking at my kid’s rooms, I saw 25-30 cheap plastic trophies.&amp;nbsp; They were covered in dust. 
Some were broken – missing heads, bats, or something. 
I thought, there has to be something better.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;These bats started as an alternative to trophies for Little League teams, but now are used as momentos at weddings, as baby announcements with name, date, weight etc engraved, and with slogans for corporate events, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.escapefromcubiclenation.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/babygluten.jpg&quot; onclick=&quot;window.open(this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=150,height=100,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39;); return false&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;100&quot; height=&quot;66&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;Babygluten&quot; title=&quot;Babygluten&quot; src=&quot;http://www.escapefromcubiclenation.com/get_a_life_blog/images/babygluten.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;10.&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.greattasteglutenfree.com/&quot;&gt;Great Taste Gluten Free&lt;/a&gt; cookies round out our list with a bang.&amp;nbsp; Like many of the other founder stories, Steve Kirk started the company for personal reasons:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Earlier this year my wife, Carol, and I started a gluten-free bakery. Carol has Celiac Disease, an auto-immune disorder where gluten in food causes the body to attack the lining of the small intestine. (For more information go to&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.celiac.com&quot;&gt;www.celiac.com&lt;/a&gt;) The only treatment for this disease is to eat a diet free of gluten; no wheat, barley, rye or products derived from these grains. Our products were initially developed for people with Celiac Disease. We&#39;ve since learned that many children with Autism benefit from a gluten-free/casein-free diet. We now offer a GF-CF version of our chocolate chip cookie with more flavors in the works.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the &amp;quot;Great Taste&amp;quot; part means that anyone can enjoy these cookies!&amp;nbsp; The sweetest part of this whole thing?&amp;nbsp; Steve informed me that after starting this business on the side, he learned that his job as a computer programmer was being shipped to Eastern Europe.&amp;nbsp; His last day at work?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, Friday, December 1.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How is that for poetic justice?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;---&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you so much to everyone who submitted your info to this contest!&amp;nbsp; Because I simply must highlight the other products submitted, I will put together a post this weekend with the complete list of entrants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have a great weekend everyone and thanks for playing!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US" xml:base="http://www.escapefromcubiclenation.com/get_a_life_blog/">
&lt;div xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.escapefromcubiclenation.com/photos/uncategorized/khalfanimoney_coach.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;200&quot; height=&quot;294&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://www.escapefromcubiclenation.com/get_a_life_blog/images/khalfanimoney_coach.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Khalfanimoney_coach&quot; alt=&quot;Khalfanimoney_coach&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
I just got a message today from Lynnette Khalfani, a former collaborator on an article I wrote for Startup Nation called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.startupnation.com/pages/articles/financially-prepare-entrepreneurship.asp&quot;&gt;3 Steps to Financially Prepare for Starting Your Own Business&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; She is going to be on Oprah tomorrow, in a segment on dealing with financial windfalls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lynnette found me through my blog right before I was going to write the Startup Nation article, and I jumped on the opportunity to work with someone with so much experience and expertise.&amp;nbsp; A former Wall Street Journal reporter and financial reporter for CNBC, she wrote a New York Times bestseller called &lt;a href=&quot;http://themoneycoach.net/zero_debt.htm&quot;&gt;Zero Debt&lt;/a&gt; .&amp;nbsp; She has gone on to write her latest book, &lt;a href=&quot;http://themoneycoach.net/your_first_million.htm&quot;&gt;The Money Coach&#39;s Guide to Your First Million&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But besides all that impressive professional background, the thing that excites me the most is that she is a truly humble, kind and nice person.&amp;nbsp; She is a working Mom with small kids at home and is very down-to-earth.&amp;nbsp; Not once during our conversations did I sense any ego, superiority complex or condescension.&amp;nbsp; She was excited, passionate and helpful.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the time we talked, Oprah was just launching a season-long segment on reducing debt and she featured 3 financial coaches on the show who worked with couples throughout the season to improve their financial situation.&amp;nbsp; I told Lynnette &amp;quot;You should be on the show!&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp; She agreed, but said it was a difficult thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast forward a couple of months, and here she is on Oprah!&amp;nbsp; Besides that, she just taped a show today for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rachaelrayshow.com/&quot;&gt;Rachel Ray&lt;/a&gt;, and will be featured on &lt;a href=&quot;http://tyrashow.warnerbros.com/&quot;&gt;Tyra&lt;/a&gt; as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is hard to put into words, but I am just so excited for her and feel so inspired that we can ALL think bigger and more expansively about the possibilities in our work.&amp;nbsp; I know she worked her behind off to get where she is today, and probably spent many many long hours at the computer when she was tired and overwhelmed.&amp;nbsp; But she kept going and made it happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good for you Lynnette - I can&#39;t wait to check you out tomorrow (Wednesday, December 1 - check your local station for listings.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.escapefromcubiclenation.com/photos/uncategorized/ramitce3.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;200&quot; height=&quot;236&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://www.escapefromcubiclenation.com/get_a_life_blog/images/ramitce3.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Ramitce3&quot; alt=&quot;Ramitce3&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
The next person I plan to see on Oprah discussing the very needed topic of financial education for college students and recent grads is my young pal Ramit Sethi from the very well-written, funny and educational blog &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com&quot;&gt;I Will Teach You to Be Rich&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Ramit is a 20-something Stanford grad who is taking the world by storm, all with an infectious enthusiasm and sharp wit.&amp;nbsp; He &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/archives/2006/11/announcing-the-i-will-teach-you-to-be-rich-book.html#comments&quot;&gt;just closed a book deal&lt;/a&gt; to write, not surprisingly, I Will Teach You To Be Rich. The title is a&amp;nbsp; bit tongue in cheek, for it is not a &amp;quot;get rich quick&amp;quot; scheme, but rather practical, useful financial advice for those that need it most, impressionable college students.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I met Ramit when &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/archives/2006/10/friday_entrepreneurs_pamela_sl.html&quot;&gt;he interviewed me&lt;/a&gt; on his blog awhile ago, and now one of my other very enthusiastic young blog readers Cody McKibben just &lt;a href=&quot;http://codymckibb.blogspot.com/2006/11/interview-ramit-sethi-will-not-only.html&quot;&gt;i&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://codymckibb.blogspot.com/2006/11/interview-ramit-sethi-will-not-only.html&quot;&gt;nterviewed Ramit&lt;/a&gt; on his blog.&amp;nbsp; I guarantee you will be inspired by all the things Ramit&amp;nbsp; is working on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I love about people like Lynnette and Ramit is that they are smart, funny and talented, but also genuinely nice human beings.&amp;nbsp; In my perfect world, these are the kinds of people who should get astronomical exposure so that they can make some big, lasting changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oprah&#39;s producers, if you are reading this, (ha ha, talk about fantasies!) you heard me suggest Ramit as a guest first.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Maybe because the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.escapefromcubiclenation.com/get_a_life_blog/2006/11/ready_for_some_.html&quot;&gt;Favorite Things&lt;/a&gt; frenzy is coming to a close tomorrow,&amp;nbsp; I had holidays on the mind when writing this month&#39;s Get a Life ezine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The topic is helping you navigate through the sometimes emotionally charged waters of describing your new business or career ideas to your family and relatives.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why is it that they can press buttons that no one else can?&amp;nbsp; With the holiday season coming up, it is likely that you will be rubbing elbows with your parents, siblings, Aunt Madge or Uncle Elmer.&amp;nbsp; If, in your delight to share your new career ideas at the dinner table, you get unsupportive comments, put downs or discouragement, I would rather you don&#39;t lose your cool and throw a fork at the wall, or resort to wrestling with your grown brother in the living room in front of your kids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I discuss common traps when discussing your career with relatives at the holidays:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Thinking they understand what you are talking about&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Thinking they understand that you have changed since your failed lemonade business in fifth grade&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Thinking they understand the changing job market&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Thinking they want to hear you drone on about work all day&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check out the &lt;a href=&quot;http://ganas.com/ezine/november06/&quot;&gt;full story here&lt;/a&gt;, and feel free to &lt;a href=&quot;http://ganas.com/freestuff.phtml&quot;&gt;subscribe&lt;/a&gt; to Get a Life if you don&#39;t already!

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you have any juicy, &amp;quot;career conversations gone bad when discussing with relatives&amp;quot; stories to share?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.escapefromcubiclenation.com/photos/uncategorized/work.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;200&quot; height=&quot;133&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://www.escapefromcubiclenation.com/get_a_life_blog/images/work.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Work&quot; alt=&quot;Work&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
Inspired by the brilliant &lt;a href=&quot;http://makemarketinghistory.blogspot.com/2006/11/j-train-marketing-20-minifesto.html&quot;&gt;J Train Minifesto&lt;/a&gt; written by my buddy John Dodds of &lt;a href=&quot;http://makemarketinghistory.blogspot.com/&quot;&gt;Make Marketing History&lt;/a&gt;, Hugh McLeod of the popular blog &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gapingvoid.com&quot;&gt;Gaping Void&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gapingvoid.com/Moveable_Type/archives/003455.html&quot;&gt;put out a call&lt;/a&gt; for less-than-500 word &amp;quot;minifestos&amp;quot; that can change the world. Probably the most famous manifesto, in the internet world anyway, is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://cluetrain.com/&quot;&gt;Cluetrain&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Hugh wrote his own version which I also really love called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gapingvoid.com/Moveable_Type/archives/000823.html&quot;&gt;The Hughtrain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But as he said, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Why take 50,000 words [the length of your average business tome] to say what you have to say, when 500 will do? Brevity. I love brevity. We&#39;re both in a hurry. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I&#39;m thinking, well, there&#39;s also a lot of people out there besides myself and the bloggers I read, with ideas needing spread. Powerful ideas that could be easily summed up in 500 words or less. And I would really, truly, seriously like to do what I can to help get them out there.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;He has gotten over a hundred submissions, by a whole range of people from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gapingvoid.com/Moveable_Type/archives/003464.html&quot;&gt;Seth Godin&lt;/a&gt; to my buddy &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gapingvoid.com/Moveable_Type/archives/003476.html&quot;&gt;Anna Farmery&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theengagingbrand.com/&quot;&gt;The Engaging Brand&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am never one to resist a challenge, so I threw my hat in the ring:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Work Manifesto&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;by Pamela Slim &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Work &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; your real life&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;nbsp; It is the way you translate your feelings, your thoughts, your hopes and your desires into something valuable, tangible and useful every day. You can choose to make work&amp;nbsp; into a dreaded, necessary evil that you can&#39;t wait to finish so that you can get busy with your &amp;quot;real life.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp; Why not just do work you love? &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Good work will improve your sex life&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Frustrated employees desperately long for excitement and release in the form of fantasy football, internet surfing, porn, and the affections of their stressed and overworked spouses.&amp;nbsp; No superhero could fill the gigantic void of a passionless man or woman in a 15-minute tryst in bed.&amp;nbsp; Express your passion through your work every day, all day, and find that you will&amp;nbsp; be less needy, more attentive, open, giving and loving to your partner.&amp;nbsp; Which makes for better sex. &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your secret desire holds the clue to your best work&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;nbsp; You say that you would love to do meaningful work, but don&#39;t know how to find it.&amp;nbsp; What is your secret desire?&amp;nbsp; What idea are you a little embarrassed to share with someone because it is so delicate or bold or crazy or exciting?&amp;nbsp; You often claim to not know what you want to do, but in fact censor yourself from what you&amp;nbsp; know you want&amp;nbsp; for fear of appearing ridiculous. &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You can&#39;t fool your kids&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Many of you claim passionless, dull and frustrating careers with the excuse that you must provide for your family.&amp;nbsp; Providing for your family is noble; using it as an excuse to hide from your own greatness is a bad example for your kids.&amp;nbsp; If you want them to grow up motivated, creative, free and enterprising, be that yourself.&amp;nbsp; They are watching and emulating&amp;nbsp; your every move. &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fear is the great inhibitor&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;nbsp; All of the excuses that you find for not doing work you love have solutions.&amp;nbsp; You do not enact them because you are afraid: of showing up too big in the world; of failing; of appearing as an imposter; of living in poverty.&amp;nbsp; There is nothing wrong with fear.&amp;nbsp; Feel it, talk to it, examine it and walk with it.&amp;nbsp; Then step out and let yourself show up, warts and all.&amp;nbsp; It will liberate you. &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Owning is better than renting&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;nbsp; While you may feel &amp;quot;safer&amp;quot; renting out your skills for a paycheck and benefits, you often sell all your energy this way and have nothing left at the end of the day.&amp;nbsp; If you don&#39;t get what you need in this employment arrangement in terms of money, recognition, power or responsibility, you feel angry and frustrated.&amp;nbsp; Own the means of production and the factory, and at least your glorious disasters will be your disasters.&amp;nbsp; Accountability breeds passion and desire.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;---&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who knows if Hugh will publish mine, but I sure did enjoy writing it!&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And just a word of warning for those of you new to Gaping Void ... some of the content is definitely edgy and&amp;nbsp; Rated R, so if profanity offends you or is prohibited by your internet surfing policies at work, you may want to steer clear of the site. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.escapefromcubiclenation.com/photos/uncategorized/img001_4.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;200&quot; height=&quot;291&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;Img001_4&quot; title=&quot;Img001_4&quot; src=&quot;http://www.escapefromcubiclenation.com/get_a_life_blog/images/img001_4.jpg&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
Come January, you will be most likely deluged by &amp;quot;get rid of that holiday flab&amp;quot; commercials till you can&#39;t stand it.&amp;nbsp; So I don&#39;t want to harp on that angle, since I find it personally demotivating to exercise for reason of my jiggly thighs or emerging love handles.&amp;nbsp; In fact, that just makes me want to eat more ice cream and stuff my face with cookies, since I am a rebel when it comes to any kind of authority telling me what to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, I strongly believe that physical health contributes to mental clarity, increased energy and overall well-being.&amp;nbsp; I am a total extremist ... either I work out like a fanatic, or I do nothing at all.&amp;nbsp; In my twenties when this picture was taken (25 to be exact), I did 17 classes a week of martial arts and had abs that would make Janet Jackson look bad (in her lean and mean phases, of course!).&amp;nbsp; I then moved on to yoga, pilates and lifting weights in my 30s, which generally made me feel strong and unstressed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I became a Mom and work at home coach and writer, and have found my usual activity level is reduced to walking up and down the stairs a few times a day.&amp;nbsp; And my late night writing sessions are fueled by cookies and ice cream ... not the celery sticks I really should eat.&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.andywibbels.com&quot;&gt;Andy Wibbels&lt;/a&gt; wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;http://andywibbels.com/post/1073&quot;&gt;very funny post about &amp;quot;bookfat&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; .. the pounds gained by first-time authors during the year that they write, revise and publish their book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am thinking we have a new phenomenon called &lt;strong&gt;blogfat&lt;/strong&gt; ... which is really an aversion to doing anything physical that takes us away from crafting a new post.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I propose that we support each other virtually to do a little moving and shaking that doesn&#39;t involve incoming blog links, but actual physical exercise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For my part, I joined a local martial arts studio and will be doing 2 short classes a week on Monday and Wednesday evenings.&amp;nbsp; I had my first class last week and almost passed out as I tried to fire off rapid kicks since I am so out of shape.&amp;nbsp; But I am willing to try baby steps and take a few minutes each day to do some situps, pushups or squats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because I know that when I do exercise, my mind clears, ideas emerge, and my intuition feels much more &amp;quot;tuned up,&amp;quot; since it usually speaks through the physical, not intellectual realm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What kind of exercise could you start that would make you feel a little less lethargic, get working on a bit of your blogfat and shake some creative ideas loose?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

I hope everyone had a nice weekend!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to share a couple of reminders today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Promote your product or service!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My &lt;em&gt;Pam&#39;s Favorite Things&lt;/em&gt; contest deadline is tomorrow, Tuesday November 28 at whatever time I fall asleep (usually about midnight Mountain Time U.S. (GMT -7).&amp;nbsp; I encourage you or your entrepreneurial loved ones to submit a favorite gift product for consideration.&amp;nbsp; If you missed the original post with a description of the contest and guidelines, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.escapefromcubiclenation.com/get_a_life_blog/2006/11/ready_for_some_.html&quot;&gt;here it is&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And although a few people have scolded me for contributing to the mass hysteria that we call the holiday shopping season, I have received lots of very creative, interesting and inspiring product submissions created by people just like you and me, looking to make a living doing work they love.&amp;nbsp; I know not everyone celebrates Christmas or New Years on Jan 1, but often it is a time of year when relatives get together and it is nice to bring a gift along.&amp;nbsp; My business is promoting small businesses, so I leave it to your good ethics and creative minds to not come up with mindless, consumerist drivel.&amp;nbsp; We will leave that up to the large companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Free Escape from Cubicle Nation Teleconference Call on December 6&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the past couple of months, I have been hosting free conference calls on the first Wednesday of the month and inviting blog readers and podcast listeners to join in and share what is on their mind.&amp;nbsp; Some have been large groups and some very small, but we always have a good time discussing issues and challenges about starting a small business and finding ways to support and encourage each other.&amp;nbsp; The next call is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wednesday, December 6&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8-9pm Eastern Standard Time (5pm Pacific, 6pm Mountain, 7pm Central, 2am London!)&lt;br /&gt;To sign up, send a blank email to &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:dec6teleclass@aweber.com&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;dec6teleclass@aweber.com&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been playing around with the times a bit to make sure I don&#39;t leave anyone out who can&#39;t participate during work hours.&amp;nbsp; My U.K. friends got shorted this time, but hopefully some others can join that weren&#39;t able to before.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make sure that I am not spamming you, you *must* reply to the confirmation message you get after signing up.&amp;nbsp; It will come from me - pcs (at) ganas (dot) com and the subject will be &amp;quot;Confirm your request for information from dec6teleclass&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp; Just follow the simple instructions in the email and you will verify your sign-up and receive the call-in details. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you can&#39;t make it for whatever reason, I will record the call and share it with those that sign up. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I look forward to hearing from you soon!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Knowing that Thanksgiving is upon us tomorrow in the U.S., I thought I would take a minute to express my extreme gratitude for all the people who have come into my life in the past year.&amp;nbsp; Most have come right here through this blog, which has become a comforting, occasionally raucous and always interesting place to host.&amp;nbsp; I don&#39;t see myself so much as the owner as the facilitator, throwing out thoughts that YOU, dear readers, share with me in the form of questions, comments and emails.&amp;nbsp; I have so much fun writing here that I sometimes wonder when the big joke is going to end and I will wake up and realize it was just a delicious dream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So thank you for:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;My band of U.K. based buddies &lt;a href=&quot;http://makemarketinghistory.blogspot.com/&quot;&gt;John&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.iscatterlings.com&quot;&gt;Robert &lt;/a&gt;and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theengagingbrand.com&quot;&gt;Ann&lt;/a&gt; who (depending on who is writing) alternately encourage, cajole, tease, reprimand (which Robert does when I stay up too late) and generally make me proud that my ancestors came from those little islands. (Although Robert is from Southern Africa, but resides in the U.K. - he did publish an interview with me today, coincidentally, but that is not why I linked to him!)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;My encouraging and smart friends &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.entrepreneurialmd.com/index/#blog&quot;&gt; Philippa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thetoymaker.com&quot;&gt;Marilyn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.booksbyglenda.com&quot;&gt;Glenda&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lifeofplay.com/&quot;&gt;Lisa&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.men-at-pause.com/&quot;&gt;Matt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.men-at-pause.com/&quot;&gt;hew&lt;/a&gt;. Thank you for&amp;nbsp; keeping me in line, sharing knowledge, talking me off a ledge when someone blasts me or I get overwhelmed, and generally being fun to hang out with.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Longtime readers and frequent and prolific commenters &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.inspions.net/&quot;&gt;Murali&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://diary-of-an-ad-man.blogspot.com/&quot;&gt;Geoff&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://ideamatt.blogspot.com/&quot;&gt;Matthew&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.coaching4lesbians.com/blog/&quot;&gt;Paula&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://carlagolden.blogs.com/&quot;&gt;Carla&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.keithhandy.com/internets/&quot;&gt;Keith&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://artoutside.blogspot.com/&quot;&gt;Jeff&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; I appreciate that you have been readers of the blog for a long time and often share your thoughts in comments.&amp;nbsp; Murali, we don&#39;t always agree on everything, but you always make me think and challenge me to do better, and for that I am very grateful.&amp;nbsp; Thanks &lt;a href=&quot;http://nancyfriedman.typepad.com/away_with_words/2006/11/thanksgiving_li.html&quot;&gt;Nancy &lt;/a&gt;for inspiring this post with yours, and congrats again on being a Typepad featured blog!&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;All of you who have provided instant, problem-solving advice for various technical challenges I have faced in publishing the blog and the podcast.&amp;nbsp; You really should send me a bill!&amp;nbsp; I don&#39;t have the links to all your blogs, but Matthew, Andy, Don, Dan, Andy, Derrik, Kris and many others, you know who you are!&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.getknownnowblog.com&quot;&gt;Suzanne&lt;/a&gt;, who got me started on this blog adventure!&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;All my clients - thank you for trusting me to work with you.&amp;nbsp; You let me express my creative self through work and for that, I feel very lucky.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;My &amp;quot;adopted professors&amp;quot; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bobsutton.net&quot;&gt;Dr. Bob&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.areyoureadytosucceed.com&quot;&gt;Dr. Srikumar&lt;/a&gt; who always weigh in with encouraging words and wise perspectives.&amp;nbsp; You almost make me want to get a Master&#39;s degree just so I can spend more time hanging out with you.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;My &amp;quot;link sugar daddy&amp;quot; &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.guykawasaki.com/&quot;&gt;Guy&lt;/a&gt; who has graciously shared some of my posts this year with his large legion of smart and entrepreneur-loving readers and who is always positive and encouraging.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.startupnation.com&quot;&gt;Rich and Jeff&lt;/a&gt;, thank you for making me feel like an honorary Sloan sister.&amp;nbsp; I love to watch how you creatively grow Startup Nation, and have been extremely impressed with the integrity you show in working with business partners.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.presentationzen.com&quot;&gt;Garr &lt;/a&gt;and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.headrush.typepad.com&quot;&gt;Kathy&lt;/a&gt;, I worship your smarts, creativity and kick-butt blogs and am thankful that I have good models to emulate.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;My dear husband, family, and best friend Desiree who don&#39;t always understand what I am typing at a furious pace most nights, but always are (or act anyway!) excited to hear about my exploits, and share my excitement at the many glorious triumphs of my readers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;













&lt;p&gt;And for the many, many hundreds of you who have shared your stories, your dreams and your fears with me. I don&#39;t want to leave anyone out!&amp;nbsp; I feel very priviledged to have your confidence and promise to do my best to create content that provides a path, encourages you, reduces your feelings of isolation and fires you up to start your own business.&amp;nbsp; I appreciate the way that so many of you have evangelized this blog and gotten the message out to people who need it. 



&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are going out of town to Flagstaff, Arizona for four days so things should be a bit quiet on the blog front.&amp;nbsp; And since I am going to be with my husband&#39;s relatives who are Navajo, I wanted to share what we often discuss at Thanksgiving:&amp;nbsp; gratefulness for family, for health, for life, and for always &amp;quot;walking in beauty,&amp;quot; knowing that as their traditional prayers say, beauty is always above you, below you, before you, behind you and within you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enjoy!&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Another one of my frequent blog readers and commenters, J. Timothy King, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jtse.com/blog/2006/11/10/yes-ive-left-normal&quot;&gt;informed his friends&lt;/a&gt;, family and cyberspace in general that he gave notice at his job and will be formally self-employed by Thanksgiving.&amp;nbsp; After talking about parallels with recent episodes of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000TPA6K?tag=jtse-20&amp;amp;creative=373489&amp;amp;camp=211189&amp;amp;link_code=as3&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B0000TPA6K&quot;&gt;Roswell&lt;/a&gt; that he was watching, he said:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Wednesday morning, as my wife was faxing a contract I had signed as a consultant, I asked my manager to chat in the conference room. I told him that I had wanted for some time to start my own business. He knew this, though he may have forgotten or may not have realized how serious I was. I said, “I’m going into consulting, so as of November 22, I resign.”

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We left the way open for me to do further work for him, under contract. But for now, I’m really on my way out. The paperwork has officially been set in motion. I am officially now self-employed. Or at least I will be giving thanks for that, come Thanksgiving, whether I want to or not. The consulting job will have me working with an old friend, a developer I met many years ago, while we were still in college. Aside from working with some good developers— I know they’re good: I’ve seen their code. This project will also allow me some flexibility to build my business, to refine the idea and prove the technology. Most importantly, it will force me to treat the job like a business. It will force me to be truly and solely self-employed.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s the scary part. Fear is what actually held back Liz and Max in Roswell. That’s the only thing that could hold me back. What if I can’t find enough consulting clients to provide for my family? What if I don’t have the energy to do consulting and build my business? What if my business idea falls flat?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The kind of fears that Tim faces as he takes his first steps on his own are unavoidable.&amp;nbsp; But with planning, connecting with others, optimism, tenacity and a bit of blind faith thrown in, I know Tim will make it through.&amp;nbsp; I love his parting quote, also borrowed from the diary of one of the characters from the Roswell episode:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The episode then ends with this passage from Liz’s diary:

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &#39;The tough thing about following your heart is what people forget to mention, that sometimes your heart takes you to places you shouldn’t be, places that are as scary as they are exciting and as dangerous as they are alluring, and sometimes your heart takes you to places that can never lead to a happy ending… And that’s not even the difficult part. The difficult part is when you follow your heart, you leave normal, you go into the unknown… And once you do, you can never go back.&#39;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something deep inside my gut tells me I will never work in a cube farm again.
