From an article at InfoQ, to a donation from Geoffry Grossenbach, rubinius is making waves.  I was able to corner Evan for an interview over email recently.  Here's what we talked about. 



Evan, thanks for agreeing to do this interview.  Would you mind starting out by introducing yourself?

What made you decide to write springy in JRuby?

If you profile just a part of your code, is it possible to accumulate over multiple "parts"? For example, I want to profile a Rails action invocation, but I really want to profile 100 invocations.
