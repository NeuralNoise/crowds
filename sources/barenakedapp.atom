			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Update</h3>
<p>Three buyers are very interested at this time. I&#8217;ve spent a lot of time emailing back and forth, making phone calls and preparing documents. It&#8217;s all pretty time consuming, but very interesting. I think we&#8217;re getting close to receiving formal bids. Everyone is aware and comfortable with the current minimum bid of $900K USD.</p>
<p>My biggest fear was that by live-blogging the sale, I would scare away buyers. <strong>The opposite has been true.</strong> Everyone who has gotten in touch said they find it fascinating and they appreciate the openness.</p>
<h3>Meanwhile &#8230;</h3>
<p>Gill came across something that made me laugh. She found an old photo of me in Carson Systems&#8217; first office (our top bedroom!). </p>
<p><img id="image112" src="http://www.barenakedapp.com/wp-content/uploads/ryan.jpg" /></p>
<p>Gotta love that! An old crappy PC, a cactus plant, and two wooden desks!</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a look at Carson Systems now. Wow, things sure change quickly. We&#8217;ve now got our own office, <a href="http://alistapart.com/articles/fourdayweek">a four-day working week</a>, five employees, gorgeous Mac gear, daily fresh fruit shakes and fresh ground coffee. Can&#8217;t complain!</p>
<p><img id="image113" src="http://www.barenakedapp.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_3475.jpg" alt="IMG_3475.jpg" /></p>
<p><img id="image114" src="http://www.barenakedapp.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_3471.jpg"/></p>
<p><img id="image115" src="http://www.barenakedapp.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_3470.jpg" /></p>
<p><img id="image116" src="http://www.barenakedapp.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_3469.jpg" /></p>
<p><img id="image117" src="http://www.barenakedapp.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_3468.jpg" /></p>
<h3>On another note &#8230;</h3>
<p>Someone <a href="http://www.dkltd.net/spending-zero-money-on-advertising/">called me out</a> about my claim that we spend zero money on advertising.</p>
<p>I know you are never going to believe me, but I had forgotten about that ad. We spent £1800 on it (we got reduced rates because it was a slow month for the magazine), and we got one sign up (a Business Plan user) off it. The ad ran for 30 days in July (I think).</p>
<p>What does that prove? It’s hard to say. Possibilities:</p>
<ol>
<li>DropSend is not right for the audience.</li>
<li>The reason we got the ad so cheap is because the readership is down.</li>
<li>The design of the ad wasn’t compelling enough.</li>
</ol>
<p>Anyway, thanks for calling me out. I had honestly forgotten we did this ad (probably because it was such a dismal failure).

</ul>
<p><img id="image106" src="http://www.barenakedapp.com/wp-content/uploads/plan-breakdown-small.png" alt="DropSend Plans" /></p>
<p>Now here is the breakdown of the monthly revenue over these plans:</p>
<ul>
<li>Basic: $1080</li>
<li>Standard: $1413</li>
<li>Pro: $1710</li>
<li>Business: $4257</li>
</ul>
<p><img id="image111" src="http://www.barenakedapp.com/wp-content/uploads/plan-breakdown-rev-small.png" alt="plan-breakdown-rev-small.png" /></p>
<p>This data communicates something very clearly: there is money to be made in SMB, premium plans. <strong>50% of our revenue comes from only 11% of our customers.</strong>.</p>
<p>I had an interesting conversation with Jason Fried of <a href="http://www.37signals.com">37signals</a> about these numbers. We both agreed that $5 plans are a lot of hard work, for very little money.</p>
<p>My advice for those of you building web apps based on monthly subscriptions: have a plan for getting people off of the low-paying plans. Or maybe don&#8217;t offer a low-paying plan at all.</p>
<p>With DropSend, we found the best way to get people to upgrade is by offering them a coupon. By upgrading before a specific date, they would save anywhere between 10% - 100% of the first month.</p>
<p>Side note: You&#8217;ll notice that the numbers for November on both graphs look like they tail off a bit. This is because we&#8217;re only nine days into November.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong></p>
<p>We had a request for the number of users over the months. Here you go:</p>
<p>December 2005: 4,249<br />
January 2006: 8,430<br />
February 2006: 12,478<br />
March 2006: 17,628<br />
April 2006: 22,206<br />
May 2006: 27,882<br />
June 2006: 33,665<br />
July 2006: 38,953<br />
August 2006: 44,635<br />
September 2006: 50,144<br />
October 2006: 56,611<br />
November 2006: 58,462</p>
<p>Important note: Every time you send a file to someone, it creates an account for them. Therefore these numbers don&#8217;t really represent the actual growth of DropSend. A better representation would be how many registrations we get. Unfortunately we just started tracking this. Nine days into November, we&#8217;ve gotten 249.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Well, there have been a ton of both positive and negative comments related to <a href="http://www.barenakedapp.com/dropsend/dropsend-monthly-profit">my post on our monthly profit figures</a>. I&#8217;d like to take some time to respond to the negative comments.</p>
<p>Here we go &#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>As others have noted, the “profit” really isn’t a real number. There is no accounting for support, future development, company overhead etc. If you assume everything can be handled by two people — an engineer at $60k and an admin person at $30k — your entire profit is gone. And you don’t even have an office, phones, foosball table or any of the stuff that makes a business fun.</p></blockquote>
<p>The current high bidders for DropSend do not plan on running it as stand-alone company. It simply does not have the revenue to support this. Therefore, the costs for management are assumed to be absorbed by someone who is already on their staff.</p>
<blockquote><p>While the revenue growth is impressive, there is less than a year of history. The projected numbers are very nice, but completely unprovable at this point. Anyone with Excel and itchy fingers can build the same model.</p></blockquote>
<p>Our growth estimates are <em>very</em> conservative. We do not, in any way, have &#8220;itchy fingers&#8221;. If that was the case, I&#8217;d be bumping those growth figures up by a few percentage points. It&#8217;s perfectly reasonable to predict that revenue would grow with increased advertising. However, just to be safe, we&#8217;ve left the current revenue growth at 8.6% and not increased it.</p>
<blockquote><p>3) The product is a one-trick pony, not a platform driving broader adoption. That puts a limit on the multiple you’re going to get too.</p></blockquote>
<p>Wrong. This is what makes DropSend so valuable. It&#8217;s <em>damn</em> good at <em>one</em> thing: sending large files.</p>
<blockquote><p>Selling is one way to make money with a business, but running a Business that is profitable is usually better. I think this is the source of some of the skepticism about this sale. If it is indeed profitable then why the need to sell?</p></blockquote>
<p>When a business is sold (in the UK), you enjoy 75% tax relief on the sale. This is because the government wants to encourage citizens to build businesses, sell them and thus bolster the economy. This is why I said &#8220;Businesses are built to be sold.&#8221; If you don&#8217;t plan on selling your business at some point, you&#8217;re missing out on a perfectly legal way to enjoy the profit you&#8217;ve created.</p>
<blockquote><p>the fact that its not being advertised means project mostly depends on Ryan’s connections and exposure for publicity, which makes it even less attractive once it is disconnected from Carson&#8217;s.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is just not true. I&#8217;d say that 99% of DropSend customers have never even heard of &#8220;Ryan Carson&#8221;. Why is DropSend growing? Because it&#8217;s viral. Every time you send a file to someone, it says &#8220;File sent by dropsend.com&#8221; at the bottom of the email. This virality is enough to achieve our 8.6% growth per month. If someone to invest, say, $10K on a concerted marketing campaign, those figures could increase substantially.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Well, here we go!</p>
<h4>How much profit does DropSend bring in each month?</h4>
<ul>
<li>Revenue: $9,041.81 per month (and growing by 8.6% per month)</li>
<li>Costs: $2,100 per month (Servers at 365main.com + maintenance)</li>
<li>Profit: $6,941.81 per month</li>
</ul>
<p><img id="image102" src="http://www.barenakedapp.com/wp-content/uploads/ds-rev2.png" alt="DropSend Graph" /></p>
<p>The above image is from our new stats package that we just installed.</p>
<h4>Predicted Revenue Growth?</h4>
<p>So how fast is Dropsend revenue growing? A lot :) By the Dec &#8216;07, based on very conservative estimates, it will be bringing in <strong>$21,000+ per month</strong>.</p>
<p>The extraordinary thing about this growth, is that we do zero advertising for DropSend. This is purely viral growth. If the buyer of DropSend spends a reasonable ($10K?) on advertising, it should easily double those revenues.</p>
<h4>So why are you selling?!</h4>
<p>Businesses are built to be sold. Some take a long time to build and sell, some take less. We feel it&#8217;s time to capitalize on our initial investment. The timing is perfect for us.</p>
<p>Let me be clear: Carson Systems does not need cash - that&#8217;s not what this is about. We don&#8217;t have a cent of debt and are profitable as a company.

		<description><![CDATA[Here&#8217;s the latest on what&#8217;s going on with the sale. I have to admit, things are moving faster than I thought they would. It&#8217;s getting kind of crazy (in a good way).

Here are the type of companies that have expressed interest:

Hosting companies
Software companies
Browsers

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here&#8217;s the latest on what&#8217;s going on with the sale. I have to admit, things are moving faster than I thought they would. It&#8217;s getting kind of crazy (in a good way).</p>
<p><img src="http://www.barenakedapp.com/wp-content/uploads/dsemails.png" alt="DropSend emails" /></p>
<p>Here are the type of companies that have expressed interest:</p>
<ol>
<li>Hosting companies</li>
<li>Software companies</li>
<li>Browsers</li>
<li>Small, medium and large web app shops</li>
<li>Web design companies</li>
<li>Email hosting companies</li>
<li>CRM companies</li>
<li>Various entrepreneurs</li>
</ol>
<p>I think I made a mistake by disclosing that I was IM&#8217;ing Geoff Arrone from Flock and I&#8217;ve sent him an apology over email. We won&#8217;t be disclosing the companies or names of those who get in touch from now on.</p>
<p>The goal of blogging about the sale of DropSend is to de-mystify the process for everyone. We are totally inexperienced at this and we thought it would be useful for everyone to learn from our experience.</p>
<p>Let the adventure continue!

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Wow, as soon as we <a href="http://www.barenakedapp.com/dropsend/were-selling-dropsend">announced the sale of DropSend</a> the emails started coming in.</p>
<p>So far we&#8217;ve received <strike>five</strike> six emails expressing interest. I also had an IM conversation with Geoffrey Arrone (from <a href="http://www.flock.com">Flock</a>).</p>
<p>We had several comments asking why would sell, if DropSend is profitable and requires very little maintenance. Here&#8217;s why:</p>
<p>DropSend could be even more successful if someone focused 100% of their attention on it.</p>
<p>As I said, we do zero marketing or advertising for it. This is because we don’t have enough time to focus on it (because we&#8217;re a small company). If someone devoted solid time to it, it would grow at an even faster rate. I believe it could double or triple it&#8217;s current revenue.</p>
<p>It’s like having a racing horse that has the potential to win the Grand National, and never taking it out to run.</p>
<p>So, the next step will be to publish our user stats and financial figures. Stay tuned &#8230;
